PURPOSE
-------

This module allows sites that deploy GSI-related technologies to put the gridmap file
contents into LDAP for simpler administration in larger environments. Traditionally,
the gridmap file resides at /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile. It is used by GSI-enabled
services (GSISSH, GridFTP, GRAM) to translate a GSI certificate DN to a local user 
account. In multi node installations, keeping the grid map files in sync can become
quite tedious and error prone. Placing the translation in LDAP centralizes and simplifies
administration.

Another feature called gridmap_override is provided to work in conjunction with the
LDAP capabilities. If the file /etc/grid-security/gridmap_override exists, it is
used to translate between GSI DN's and local user names for temporary overriding of
the grid map translations. It is possible to tranlate from a given DN to a local user
or you may translate from one username to another.

For example, user 'admin' receives a help ticket that user 'bob' is having problems
with the system through GridFTP. Typically, this results in numerous emails back and
forth between the admin and end user 'bob' which generally only adds to user frustration
and dissatisfaction. With the override capability, the admin can make single entry in
/etc/grid-security/gridmap_override:

admin bob

With the above entry, when the user 'admin' logs into GridFTP, he will be logged in as
user 'bob'. This gives the admin the capability to diagnose and resolve issues in 
fashion similar to su. Likewise, the admin could have chosen to translate from his
GSI DN to user bob instead. The end result is the same:

"/C=US/O=National Center for Supercomputing Applications/CN=Admin User" bob

This module is also capable of hooking into the PAM subsystem for controlling user
login rights. In typical GSI-related installations, in order to prohibit user login,
the user's account had to be removed or the DN-to-user translation had to be removed from
the grid map file. By plugging into PAM, an administrator can make use of traditional
pam_access and pam_nologin modules to have fine-grain control over user login capabilities.
This proves to be very useful during maintenance periods when admins need to test interfaces
but restrict general user access to the system.

Note that the PAM-related functionality is limited to pam_access and pam_nologin. Other
PAM modules may or may not work.

OVERVIEW
--------
This module works by taking advantage the authz callout infrastructure in Globus code that
is intended for gridmap translations. There are multiple components which need to be placed
accordingly on the target system:

1) The built library libgridmap_callout.so
2) The authz callout configuration file gsi-authz.conf
3) The PAM configuration file 'gridftp'
4) The override file /etc/grid-security/gridmap_override


BUILDING
--------
In order to build this module, you must have the ldap-devel, pam-devel and globus-gssapi-gsi-devel
packages installed in addition to the C compiler and Make utilities.

% make

This should produce the library libgridmap_callout.so.

INSTALLATION
------------
The library should be copied somewhere on the system that is generally accessible
to all GSI services. The simplest installation could put the library into /usr/local/lib64/.

Copy the provided gsi-authz.conf to a location that is generally accessible to the system
such as /usr/local/etc/.

Copy the provided 'gridftp' file to the PAM configuration directory (/etc/pam.d/ on RHEL).

Copy the provided 'gridmap_override' into /etc/grid-security/gridmap_override.

CONFIGURING
-----------
In order for a GSI service like SSH to find the config file gsi-authz.conf, you must set
the env variable GSI_AUTHZ_CONF to point to the file. For example, if GridFTP is launched
by xinetd on your system, add this line to GridFTP's configuration in /etc/xinetd.d/

  env += GSI_AUTHZ_CONF=/usr/local/etc/gsi-authz.conf

In order for the GSI authz callouts to find our library, gsi-authz.conf must be modified to
point to the library. In addition, the file gsi-authz.conf includes comments that allow you
to decide if you would like LDAP or LDAP+PAM support. You must pick exactly one option.

LDAP must be configured on your system; this is beyond the scope of this document. The library
expects that the GSI DNs for a specific user are provided by the key 'gridmap' in the user's
LDAP entry. A user may have more than a single DN listed. If the user does not specify a 
particular username upon connection (:globus-mapping:), the first DN is used. Otherwise, the
user is free to specify any of the available DNs listed for that user in LDAP.

Good Luck!
