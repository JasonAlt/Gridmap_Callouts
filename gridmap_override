# If the file /etc/grid-security/gridmap_override exists, lookup

# instead. This is an administrative override for purposes of
# debugging and user assistance.

# File Format:
#  - Blank lines are ignored
#  - Lines with '#' as the first non space character are comments
#    and are ignored
#  - Multiple white spaces are treated as a single white space
#  - Lines must be < 1024 characters
#  - All other lines are formatted as either
#       username1 username2
#    where username1 is actual username of authenticated user and
#    username2 is the name the user needs to masquerade as.
#    -or-
#       "GSI DN" username2
#    where "GSI DN" is the GSI DN of the certificate used by the
#    connecting user and username2 is the name the user needs to
#    masquerade as. "GSI DN" must be quoted if it contains spaces.
